	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
	<p>This lab was about setting up the structure of our CST251 file and further building our homepage.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Setting up the file structure was easy as we had previously downloaded a template in class. I am comfortable with making index.html's as well. I struggled with puting the picture of me on my homepage and the screenshots for lab 3 but I figured it out eventually.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>My homepage is now updated with links to each lab, and this is the index.html for lab 3.</p>

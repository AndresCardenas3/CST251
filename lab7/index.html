    <h1>Lab 7: Intro to CSS</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this lab we added a folder for lab 7 and created a CSS for our webpage.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I was able to create the new folder for lab 7 pretty easily, I had a little trouble with figuring out how to create the html page but figured out I needed to add a file not a folder. For the CSS I referenced the last lab and tested things out in browser then went back to atom to apply changes.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results of this lab are my I now know how to add folders to my CST251 file, and my webpage now has the font, colors and borders of my choosing.</p>

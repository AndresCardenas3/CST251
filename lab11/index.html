          <h2>Random Facts About Me:</h2>
          <p>I currently live in Hayward CA but have also lived in Danville CA, Laguna Niguel CA, Rocklin, CA, and Heath TX. I have worked in a restaurant and as a background actor. My favorite sport is basketball. My favorite color is orange. I have sound-to-color synesthesia which allows me to see color in music. I am into fashion and one of my favorite shoes is the Jordan 1 Reverse Shattered Backboards which I have included a picture of to help lengthen the webpage.</p>

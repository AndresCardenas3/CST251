        <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
        <p>In this lab we expanded on last lab where we learned and used new CSS tools. We learned how to use more than one background image, how to add transitions and animations, and how to put text in columns.</p>
        <h2>
          PROBLEMS</h2>
        <p>I was able to implement the new CSS tools rather easily, but some small problems I had were getting the animation to show but I figured out that I had forgot a part of the code. Another small problem I had was getting the columns to be seen due to lack of text which I fixed by enlarging the text.</p>
        <h2>
          RESULTS</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab are a more fun, vibrant and livley webpage created using newfound CSS tools. I added two background images, a color transition to the title text, an opacity transition to the body content, a background color animation to the body, and three columns to the paragraph text.  </p>

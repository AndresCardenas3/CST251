<h1>Lab 5: More HTML </h1>
<h2>Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of this lab was to take images from our computer and upload them to our page, and then publish the page.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>I had no challenges with this lab luckily, using my past experience of uploading images from previous labs as an example amd everything went smoothly. I even fixed some errors I had with previous labs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here are my images that I uploaded from my computer and my screenshots:</p>
